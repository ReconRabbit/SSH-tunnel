**What the SSH command does**
ssh -L 8080:200.53.76.61:8080 root@10.10.10.10


Breaking it down:

Part	Explanation
-L 8080:200.53.76.61:8080	Forward local port 8080 on Kali â†’ Russia container port 8080 (via SSH).
root@10.10.10.10	Connects to Germany container, which is reachable from host.

Your host now thinks the service is on localhost:8080.

SSH forwards packets through Germany, so they reach Russia.

Because Germany is attached to russia_net, it can reach Russia normally.
